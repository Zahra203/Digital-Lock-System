# Digital-Lock-System
A secure, Arduino-based smart lock system that uses a keypad for password authentication. The project replaces traditional lock-and-key mechanisms with a more modern, user-friendly, and tamper-resistant solution. Built with components like an Arduino Nano, 16x2 LCD, SG90 servo motor, and keypad input.
